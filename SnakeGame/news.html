<p>Start on snake game. made the basic on a canvas with the help of a turtorial. no actions yet for when you die, you have to reload page.  <p class="text-danger">Problem:</p><p> the score bar was behind the game canvas. The canvas snake game wasnt compatible
with bootstrap. unable to solve problem</p>
<p class="bg-info text-white">1/4/2021</p>
<p>start on main look of the website surrounding the snake game</p>
 <p class="text-danger">Problem:</p><p> still the score bar. tried many different containers, all overlapped with the Canvas. Also tried resizing the game and making it compatible; all attempts failed</p>
<p class="bg-info text-white">1/5/2021</p>
<p>made a "start game" webpage next to initial snake game html.
  Added a nav bar with clickable buttons leading to different htmls. including this news page and the about page</p>
<p class="text-danger">Problem:</p> <p>Tried adding the your name input box, unable to make the name display, ID did not transfer cross pages.</p>
<p class="text-info">Solved:</p><p>Added collums to snake game, initial canvas of game is not responsive, but I managed to make the score board scooch to the side.
Also tidied up the html and css coding</p>
<p class="bg-info text-white">1/6/2021</p>
<p>more work on the snake game canvas, trying to make it responsive. the score board has been fixed. added a restart button and a high score board using localstorage(not fully functional yet)</p>
<p>refurbished the start paging</p>
<p class="bg-info text-white">1/8/2021</p>
<p>Added the working highscore board and cross htmls pages working name input. </p>
<p class="text-danger">Problem:</p>
<p>When achiving a new highscore, upon pressing restart this highscore will dissapear. this is because the restart button for now, rust reloads the page, therefor the local storage gets losts. So whenever you play, you must always defeat Babooshka with a score of 2.</p>
<p class="bg-info text-white">1/9/2021</p>
<p>more resizing experiments with canvas. Added a contact page(not functional) using php, coding was a bit too advanced for me, so I gave up on that for now. Designed some simple style sheets with style and logo color shemes, for fun.</p>
<p class="bg-info text-white">1/10/2021</p>
<p>Succesfully made the snake game responsive and have a pretty good layout! Added little design details like header and logo. Also made a dope start game neon buttons using codeSTACKr's youtube turtorial: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqCrQScnqV8&ab_channel=codeSTACKr">Click here!<a></p>
<p class="text-info">Solved:</p> <p>Fixed the highscore problem, by adding an if statements thats checks, when you start up the page, who has the highest score. you cannot see others peoples scores, but you can try to beat your personal best</p>
<p class="bg-info text-white">1/11/2021</p>
<p>I added in a nice looking footer on the index page and matched colors to the actual game. everything seems to be working just fine. except for the contact page. but that is some coding skills ahead of me. overall I am satisified with how far ive come. The final product is way better than I coudlve imagined.</p>
